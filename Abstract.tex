In essence the project is an implementation of Robotron in PyGame, using Model-View-Controller, with a Flask based high scores bored. The main content of the code is in the game itself, with flask acting only as an API. This allows for shared usage of the route by a static web page, and by the PyGame code itself. The webpage is simply served off as static, where JS is able to communicate with the API to retrieve the information needed. The database used is Postgres.
